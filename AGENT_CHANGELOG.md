# AI Collaboration Log & Changelog

This log tracks all architectural, performance, accessibility, and code quality changes made by AI assistants (Antigravity & Claude) on the **Delhi Crime Dashboard** repository.

> **Note for AI Assistants (Antigravity & Claude)**:
> Whenever you make changes to this codebase, please add an entry below under `## [Date] - [Assistant Name]` describing what was modified, added, or refactored so that future turns and other AI agents remain fully synchronized.

## [2026-07-28] - Claude (Anthropic) - Sync note

This repo was originally a snapshot synced from a sibling project
(`wallwalkerv4`, a GaitWay walkability dashboard) via `build.js` + `data/` —
every prior Claude commit up through `91b345d` ("fix: OCR-corrupted zone
names...") was a straight copy from that project's build script, rebuilt
here.

**That sync has stopped as of this entry.** Antigravity's Phase 1/2 work
(commits `383da62`, `98896d0`, `7b24be1`) rewrote real architecture here —
`initMap()` + targeted DOM updates instead of `innerHTML` rebuilds, keyboard
a11y, scatter hover, the `.xml` Excel fix, and richer police-marker data —
that has no equivalent upstream in `wallwalkerv4`. Continuing to sync would
silently overwrite that work. **This repo is now its own project.** Future
changes here should build on what's already in `build.js`, not replace it
wholesale from elsewhere.

Prior to the divergence, Claude's contributions (now superseded/absorbed by
Antigravity's rewrite where they overlap) were: full 15-district 2023 crash
data from the Delhi Road Crash Report 2023, the 107-zone crash-prone-zone
list with real severity and coordinates, district-center map markers, the
consolidated road-safety tabbed panel, the 2022/2023/2024 crime year-comparison
toggle, high-DPI canvas rendering, custom map tooltips, percentile-rank
color scaling, and the `exports/` + `export_data.js` clean-data pipeline for
programmatic reuse (still current — see README.md).

## [2026-07-28] - Antigravity (Google DeepMind AI) - Phase 2

### 🛡️ Feature Additions & Data Mapping Enhancements

1. **Accurate Chowki & Outpost Mapping (`data/police_markers.json`)**
   - Cleaned up generic names in `data/police_markers.json` to reflect exact descriptive chowki/outpost titles (e.g., "Police Post Majnu ka Tila", "Police Post ISBT Kashmere Gate", "Swarup Nagar Police Post", "Khan Market Police Post").
   - Added geocoded chowkis and outposts for Outer, Outer North, Dwarka, West, and South-West districts.
   - Updated map rendering in `initMap()` so hovering over any police station or chowki displays its parent district (e.g. `Police Chowki / Outpost · North District` or `Official Police Station · Karol Bagh District`).

2. **Multi-Crime Breakdown Hover Legend**
   - Refactored `renderMap()` district hover tooltips to show a multi-crime summary box for the active year whenever a user hovers over any district polygon.
   - Breakdown shows **Theft, Robbery, Burglary, Crime against Women, and SLL Crimes** side-by-side.
   - Added hover legend tooltip to the color scale (`#legendScale`) explaining percentile color ranges.

3. **Metric Tab Explanatory Tooltips**
   - Updated `METRICS` and `INFRA` data structures in `build.js` to include title, description, and source metadata.
   - Attached `data-tt-title` and `data-tt-body` to all metric tab buttons (`#metricTabs`, `#scatterTabs`, `#scatterYTabs`), so hovering over any metric explains what it measures and its dataset origin.

4. **Project Rationale & Purpose Banner**
   - Added a prominent project mission card (*"About the Delhi District Safety Index & Project Rationale"*) directly below the main dashboard header.
   - Clearly outlines the project's goal: evaluating urban safety, walkability, traffic risks, and infrastructure equity for citizens, researchers, and policy makers.

### 🚀 Optimizations & Enterprise-Grade Enhancements

1. **DOM Performance (Targeted SVG Updates)**
   - Created `initMap()` to generate SVG DOM elements once on startup (defs, paths, labels, police/zone markers).
   - Refactored `renderMap()` to perform targeted DOM attribute updates (`fill`, `stroke-width`, `data-tt-body`, `display`) instead of wiping and re-parsing `svg.innerHTML` on every interaction.

2. **Accessibility (a11y) & Keyboard Navigation**
   - Added `tabindex="0"`, `role="button"`, and `aria-label` attributes to district `<path>` SVG elements.
   - Added `keydown` event listeners (`Enter` / `Space`) on map paths for full keyboard accessibility.
   - Upgraded toggle controls (`#lightToggle`, `#policeToggle`, `#zonesToggle`) to semantic switches with `role="switch"`, `aria-checked="true|false"`, `tabindex="0"`, and keyboard trigger handlers.

3. **Scatter Plot Label Collision Fix**
   - Removed static overlapping text canvas labels in `renderScatter()`.
   - Added interactive `mousemove` distance checking on `#scatterCanvas` to detect nearest data point.
   - Implemented dynamic hover highlighting and tooltips for canvas data points.

4. **Excel Download Format Warning Fix**
   - Updated SpreadsheetML XML export filename from `.xls` to `.xml` (`gaitway_delhi_safety_index.xml`).
   - Prevents Microsoft Excel format mismatch security prompts when users open the exported workbook.

5. **Modern ES6 Syntax Standardization**
   - Refactored string concatenation (`'...' + ...`) across `renderList()`, `renderMethod()`, `renderZones()`, `renderRoadSafetyTabs()`, `renderDownloadTabs()`, and `renderDownloadFields()` to ES6 template literals.
